# Game Genie codes for game-and-watch-retro-go 

Place these .ggcodes in your nes/roms dir. You can put them all there and only the ones you have
roms for will be pulled into the retro go binary.

Many of these were generated from scripts, including filenames. So expect things to fix. If you have a fix, best would be to fork, fix, and send me a pull request.

A few notes:
* Code descriptions will be truncated at 25 characters when loaded into the Game and Watch
* You can have up to 16 lines in the .ggcodes loaded up. After 16 lines, the rest will be left out.
* You can comment out a line by putting # or // at the beginning
* You can have up to 3 codes in one code (XXXXXX+XXXXXX+XXXXXX). Using all 16 lines, that makes a max of 48 codes you could load in all at once
